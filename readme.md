# Recsys Playground

This is me playing around with some solutions for recommendation systems! 

## Data Source

Using the last.fm dataset from: 

`http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/index.html`


Get the 1k and 360k and put them in recsysplaygrounds/data 

## Getting Started

start and activate a virtual env with your preffered ways 
`python -m venv .env` and `.env\scripts\activate.bat` for me

install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
